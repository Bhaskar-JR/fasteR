# fasterR: Fast Lane to Learning R!

The site is for those who know nothing of R or even of programming, and
seek a quick, painless entree to the world of R.

* *FAST*:  You'll be doing good stuff in R on your first try.

* No prerequisites:  If you're comfortable with navigating the Web,
you're fine.

* **No polemics**:  You won't be made to feel guilty for not using an
instructor's favorite R tool or style. :-)
